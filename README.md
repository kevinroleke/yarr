# Yarr

A website for storing, sharing and viewing podcasts in RSS format. 

Powers https://yarr.ps

## Building

`go build --tags "fts5"`

## Confusion

This project is unrelated from [github/nkanaev/yarr](https://github.com/nkanaev/yarr). Great minds think alike? I found this deleted project using the same exact stack as mine... with the same name after I wrote a prototype of mine. Hopefully I haven't been browsing Github in my sleep recently.

This is Yarr as in the sound a pirate makes, not "Yet Another RSS Reader".
