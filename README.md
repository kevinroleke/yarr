## Confusion

This project is unrelated from [github/nkanaev/yarr](https://github.com/nkanaev/yarr). Great minds think alike? I found this project using the same stack as mine... with the same name from a year before. Hopefully I haven't been browsing Github in my sleep recently.

This is Yarr as in the sound a pirate makes, not "Yet Another RSS Reader".
